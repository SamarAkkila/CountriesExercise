# ðŸš€ Project Summary

This iOS app is built using Swift and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to fetch and display country data from a remote API. It supports real-time filtering based on user input and provides a clean, responsive UI using UIKit.

The app takes advantage of Swift Concurrency (async/await) for smooth asynchronous operations and adopts a protocol-oriented programming approach to ensure modularity and flexibility for future enhancements.
