# ðŸš€ Project Summary

This iOS app is built using Swift and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to fetch and display country data from a remote API. It supports real-time filtering based on user input and provides a clean, responsive UI using UIKit.

The app takes advantage of Swift Concurrency (async/await) for smooth and efficient asynchronous operations, and is structured to support future scalability and modularity through clear separation of concerns.
